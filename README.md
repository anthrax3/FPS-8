First person shooter game made in Unity

Besides the textures and sounds, everything was made and done by me in Unity. This includes the models and the animations.

Monsters keep on spawning, spawning in one of three locations every few seconds

WASD to move; space to jump; left click to fire; R to reload; mouse to move the camera

There are three guns - press T to swap between them

You can jump up to 5 times in the air - the number of jumps reset after landing on the ground

Enemies spawn from three locations

A health pack is in the middle of the level that respawn after being picked up after a few seconds

Currently, there is only one level. Pressing esc lets you pause the game, allowing you to quit or restart.
